* Introduction 
  This document describes  the design of =vlabs-landing-pages=.

* Design
  The virtual labs portal is built dynamically using lab
  data service since the data related to a lab - hosting
  information, lab image, etc. will change over time.  The
  lab data service provides data about different
  disciplines, institutes, labs and their hosted url.

** The case for iframes
  Each lab in virtual labs is a web application.  Since each
  lab is a web application without any API, the access to
  its content which is laid out as html files is through the
  url for each html file.  Therefore, each lab becomes an
  external source to the vlabs portal that will have to be
  embedded into the virtual labs portal.  To display the
  contents from an external source, an [[https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_iframe.asp][iframe]] is used.

** Layout
   The landing page is divided into three main
   divisions: 1. header, 2. content and 3. footer.

   The header contains all the control actions.  It is the
   controller for the portal.  The content division has an
   iframe to display the lab.  The footer division also has
   an iframe to contain the footer.html served from footer
   server. 

** Header Division
   #+caption: layout of header division
   #+name: fig:header
   [[./img/header.png]]
   
   Event handlers are attached to each of the elements in
   the header division.  The event here is either click or
   select and on the occurrence of the event, the iframe in
   the content division is loaded.  =All Labs=, =Search=,
   =Login= and =Register= are buttons while =Institutes= and
   =Disciplines= are dropdown menus.

   Events on =Login= and =Register= load login page and
   register page from the Open edX platform respectively in
   the iframe contained in the content division. 
   
   Events on the elements in the header division load the
   listing of labs in the iframe contained in the content
   division.

   The handler for either the click or select event on the
   elements -- =All Labs=, =Institutes=, =Disciplines= and
   =Search= -- constructs the content with event handlers
   attached for the click event on each of lab element
   listed.  The attached event handler opens the lab on the
   =click= event in the same iframe.

** Content Division
   This division contains the iframe.  The handlers attached
   to the elements in the header division manipulate the src
   of this iframe to display the content of the labs.

** Footer Division
   This division contains an iframe whose source is set to
   =footer.html= served from a footer service.

* Iframe Management
  The event handlers responsible for lab listing in the
  header division and the event handlers attached to each
  lab within content division manipulate the iframe inside
  it.

  Once a lab is loaded into the iframe, the handlers served
  from the portal cannot reset the content since they are of
  different origin.  To overcome this problem, every time
  content is created by the handlers in the header division,
  the existing iframe in the content division is deleted, a
  new one is created and content that is dynamically
  generated is set to the iframe.

  The handler attached for each lab listed within this
  iframe sets the source of the iframe to the url of the
  lab.

* Login and Registration
  Open edX platform login & registration infrastructure is
  used for all the labs.  
  
  A handler attached to each lab checks a cookie if a login
  happened in that browser.  If the login has not happened,
  the iframe in the content division is loaded with the
  login/registration page from Open edX platform.  If the
  user is inactive for a certain period after successful
  login/registration, the session cookie is cleared.

  Open edX does not provide the login/registration as
  services through API.  If this was not the case, the
  portal could have displayed it's own login/registration
  pages and made REST calls to the login/registration API of
  Open edX.  Since this was not the case, the portal has to
  depend on the login/registration web pages served from
  Open edX platform for user authentication.

  The event handler attached to the click event on the
  login/register buttons loads these pages in the iframe
  contained in the content division.  But how will the
  controller -- header division -- know that the user has
  either successfully logged in or registered.  The state of
  the iframe changes on a successful login or a registration
  and this state has to be captured by the controller and
  the login and register buttons should be flipped to
  =logout= button.

** Capture the state
   Since the login/register pages are served from a
   different origin than the landing pages, the controller
   in the header division cannot access the DOM element of
   the iframe to read the contents and identify the state
   change.  Therefore [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage][postMessage]] mechanism is used to relay
   the state change information from the iframe in the
   content division to the header division.  The listener in
   the header division intercepts the post message and takes
   the appropriate action of:
   1. flipping the login/register to logout and vice versa
      and
   2. setting or clearing the cookie used by the handlers to
      determine if the user is logged in that session. 


** Embedding the javascript to post message
   Since the login/register pages are served from Open edX
   portal whose code is a black box, the javascript code to
   post messages from these pages has to be inserted.  Open
   edX platform uses nginx as it's web server.  To
   accomplish the insertion of javascript for posting
   messages, nginx's [[http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_addition_module.html][http addition module]] is harnessed.
   This module allows addition of html to the requested
   resource in the response. 

   When login/register pages are requested, before the
   response is sent back by the ngnix server on the Open edX
   platform, the javascript code to post messages is
   appended.
