** Requirement 1
   Build Vlabs portal from data provided by [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service][lab data
   service]].  Currently, the VLABS portal is made of static
   web pages while the data contained in the static web
   pages like the url of a lab or an image are changing.  To
   obviate the need for changing the pages whenever the data
   changes, the portal is built using the data provided by
   lab data service.

** Requirement 2
   Build a footer service.  Currently, the footer is
   embedded in multiple pages of virtual labs.  This is
   against the principle of DRY (Do not repeat yourself).
   Instead a footer service is built, which is consumed by
   multiple pages of virtual labs.

** Requirement 3
   Build a search facility for the labs. 

** Requirement 4
   Currently, the styling of the VLABS portal is tied to the
   Open edX platform.  This is constraint in terms of
   maintenance and the ease of applying new styles.  To move
   away from this dependence, the styling of VLABS portal is
   done while the pages are rendered from the new portal.

** Requirement 5 
   Register and Sign In :: Registration and Sign In to Open
   edX platfrom is tied from the portal.  This ensures that
   when a lab that is not hosted on Open edX platform is
   accessed, the user is forced to go through the
   registration/sign-in similar to a lab hosted on Open edX
   platform.
